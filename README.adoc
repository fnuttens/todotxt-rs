WARNING: This software is currently under development, it is not ready for everyday usage (yet)

== What it is about

This tool aims at giving a practical front-end to the _todo.txt_ format.

.It is cut into two parts:
* a library crate responsible for the logic of interacting with the todo file
* a binary crate that exposes a CLI

Maybe more front-ends will come in the future, such as a desktop GUI, a webapp, or even a mobile app!

== Roadmap

Commands::
* [x] add task
* [x] mark task as done
* [ ] remove task
* [ ] list tasks
* [ ] prioritize task
* [ ] deprioritize task
* [ ] archive tasks
* [ ] update task
Other::
* [ ] manage a serialized configuration
* [ ] internationalization
* [ ] CI/CD
